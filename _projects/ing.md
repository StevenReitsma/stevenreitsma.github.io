As Lead of the Productionization Team in the 1:1-Analytics Tribe I acted as the liaison between data scientists and the platform team. I was in the lead for shaping the road to production by creating tools data scientists can use to effortlessly industrialize their models and by educating everyone involved. This involved setting up a Hadoop/Spark cluster using Ansible, developing a continuous deployment pipeline for Docker containers in Jenkins and assisting data scientists in making their applications production-ready. I helped both the data scientists and platform engineers in building their education plans regarding relevant data science and engineering skills and have given them multiple courses on e.g. Spark, Kubernetes and data science productionization.
