I did a technical internship at the European Space Agency's Test Centre.
I worked at the Mechanical Engineering Department as an expert in computer vision and machine learning.
I created a method for performing a spatial-spectral calibration of the artificial solar beam using a hyperspectral camera.
I also built a classification system for space material detection using similar hyperspectral processing techniques.
I applied my work in practice for the testing of the [BepiColombo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BepiColombo) spacecraft, which was successfully launched in October 2018 and is expected to insert into Mercury orbit in 2025.
