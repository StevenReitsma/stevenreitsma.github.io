As a Data Scientist at Nutreco I was involved in setting up the first Big Data Team within the organization. I explored which data sets and business processes were active in the company and created new projects out of my findings. One of these projects involved semantic segmentation of microscopic images to help in QA, for which I developed a highly successful deep learning solution. I also introduced the organization to AWS and Azure and deployed several data pipelines, connecting cloud and on-premise services.
