I directed and produced a feature-length movie which had a limited release in cinemas in the Netherlands and a global release on YouTube.

Synopsis: 12 members of a mafia family travel to their yearly get-together, where even their beloved Don might make an appearance. Soon, they discover there are extra security measures because the family expects one of the 12 members to have a sinister plan to kill Don Tomasso. By performing challenges, the members of the family can find out who the traitor in their midst is, in order to foil the plan to murder the Don.
