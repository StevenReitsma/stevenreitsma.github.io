I led a 7-man team building the [Advanced Analytics Platform (AAP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5cCYXE1ufc), a machine learning platform for all analysts and data scientists in the organization. We focus on both model training and model productionization and automate as much as possible for our users. The platform is based on Kubeflow and runs on top of an on-premise Kubernetes cluster. We use MinIO to provide an S3 layer and use Istio as our service mesh. Everything is deployed using Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform) and modern DevOps practices (ArgoCD, GitOps). As tech lead, I'm responsible for the platform's architecture, performance, usability and security.
