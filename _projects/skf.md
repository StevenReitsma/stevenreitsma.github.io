I implemented the cloud infrastructure of the Diagnostics & Prognostics team on AWS. The team is responsible for predicting failures of the ball bearings SKF produces. I worked on setting up cloud resources using Terraform, created automated deployment pipelines for production-ready applications and built DAGs to run on Airflow. I also deployed Databricks and connected it to AWS Glue so that researchers are able to access all data instantly. I gave a talk at the NL Big Data Expo 2019 about the project.
