Hi, my name is **Steven Reitsma**.
Years ago I started out as a data scientist but soon found out that my real passion is in data engineering and infrastructure.
After starting at BigData Republic in 2016, I'm now leading the MLOps chapter where I help my colleagues in shaping their goals and learning paths.
Next to that, I lead a team at the Dutch National Police, where we build a secure platform for data scientists to train and productionize machine learning models.

In my work I always try to bring scientists and engineers closer together.
Not only by connecting people, but also by using technology to bridge the gap.
I'm also a firm believer of open source technology and have committed to many [open source projects](https://github.com/StevenReitsma) such as Kubespray, Kubeflow, Airflow, Home Assistant, Loki and more.

In my free time I like to travel and shoot videos along the way --- thus far Yosemite (see above) is my favourite spot.
I also like to work on home automation and play "some" Factorio, Stellaris and Guild Wars 2.
