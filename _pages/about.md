Hi, my name is **Steven Reitsma**.
Years ago I started out as a data scientist but soon found out that my real passion is in data engineering and infrastructure.
After starting at BigData Republic in 2016, I was soon leading the MLOps chapter where I helped my colleagues in shaping their goals and learning paths.
Now, I have my own freelancing company and lead a team at the National Cyber Security Center, where I'm building a product that warns organisations in the Netherlands about potential cybersecurity threats.

In my work I always try to bring scientists and engineers closer together.
Not only by connecting people, but also by using technology to bridge the gap.
I'm also a firm believer of open source technology and have committed to many [open source projects](https://github.com/StevenReitsma) such as Kubespray, Kubeflow, Airflow, MinIO and more.

In my free time I like to travel and shoot video along the way.
I've also directed my own game-show, which I edited into a [feature film](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22092762/).
I also like to work on home automation, brew my own beer, regularly go to music festivals and play "some" Factorio and Guild Wars 2.
